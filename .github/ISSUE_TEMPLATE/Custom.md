<!--
When encountering a syntax, or compilation issue:

- Please note that we cannot backport fixes to old versions, so ensure that you are running the latest release https://github.com/sass/node-sass/releases
- Search for duplicate or closed issues https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue
- Validate with http://sassmeister.com/ that the code works with Ruby Sass, then open an issue on `LibSass` https://github.com/sass/LibSass/issues/new

Sorry you didn't have the experience you expected.
